# ☁️ Welcome to the Refrigerator  
_(mind your breath, you’ll see it)_

## Contents:  
- Frostbitten thoughts  
- Echoes like distant ice cracking  
- A single shrimp cocktail, leftover and judging

### ❄ Chilling Facts 
<span style="display: hidden">Butterfly31 Stranger</span>
- The clock ticks, but it’s frozen at 2:47 AM  
- There’s a soft hum you can’t place: is it the machinery, or a polar bear purring?  
- A rubber spider, lost in the back, wears a tiny scarf

#### 👁️‍🗨️  
Look—condensation forms faces on the glass. Are they sad, or just cold?

> **Tip:** Don’t open the mysterious blue Tupperware. It’s not food anymore—if it ever was.

---

### Ambient Play:

> Stand still long enough and someone will stick a post-it on your forehead labeled “Liverwurst.”

## _Shiver in style. Stay weird._
